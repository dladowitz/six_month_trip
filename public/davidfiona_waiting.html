                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    First, any of the stuff I'm going to ask  you, if you don't want to answer or whatever, feel free not to answer.  Or, if there's anything that you don't mind  telling me but you don't want us to record later, just let me know that.</p>
                    <p>David:              Thank  you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So, what's you first name?</p>
                    <p>David:              David  and Fiona.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    David and Fiona.  And what city are you in now?  What city are we in now?  What city is this interview happening in?</p>
                    <p>David:                El Salvador.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Let's see, what's today's date.  It's the…</p>
                    <p>David:              The  4th of January.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    The 4th of January.  And where are you guys originally from?</p>
                    <p>David:              The  U.K.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    U.K., what city?</p>
                    <p>David:              (Unintelligible)  Village (unintelligible) north of London.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Where….</p>
                    <p>David:              In<strong> Leeland.</strong></p>
                    <p>Fiona:              About  50 miles north of London.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Alright.   I see you guys are married.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Have  been for a long time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   And you're traveling…</p>
                    <p>David:              So  actually, we've been married for 26 years.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Twenty-six years, okay.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Because  actually, that's a funny story.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Okay.   Yes, I'm asking people if they're single, married or if they're  traveling alone.</p>
                    <p>                        And  you guys, how long have you been traveling for you said already?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              We're  in our fifth week.</p>
                    <p>David:              Five  weeks today.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    And how much longer do you have?</p>
                    <p>David:              Seven.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Seven more weeks.</p>
                    <p>David:              Three  months in total.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Three months in total, and that was the next  question.</p>
                    <p>David:              But  our plan is to travel for six months a year, four months in the winter and then  up to two months on smaller trips.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Throughout  the summer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    And what's your route so far on this trip?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              So,  we've went to Mexico City and we worked our way  (<u>1:42 unintelligible</u>) and down through Belize, into Honduras,  and then that brought us to El    Salvador.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Cool.   And that's been two months – or, that's five weeks.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              That's  five weeks so far.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So, now let's get to how you actually afford  it.  Do you have occupations now or you  said you're retired now?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              We  finished work about four years ago, and prior to that, we were both working in  business, general (<u>2:08 unintelligible</u>)  telecoms and human resources.  So, we  were in that for a long time, but we made sort of a lifestyle decision in about  '97, '98 that we would look to give up work in 2007'ish and then travel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Okay.</p>
                    <p>David:              Are  you going to ask age?</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Sure.   What's you age?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:                So David is 49 and I'm 47.</p>
                    <p>David:              49  and 46.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Do you feel – and were going to put that in,  but I didn't know if people were…</p>
                    <p>David:                You have to.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              It's  relevant.</p>
                    <p>David:              The  story's different for a younger person.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   I guess I could – I don't know how to ask that without…</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Britt's  don't get too upset about it.  You can do  it no problems.</p>
                    <p>Interviewee:    Really.  Yes, that was a thing I…</p>
                    <p>David:              You  just ask people if they're comfortable to say it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   So obviously, you're not taking any time off because you're not  necessarily working.  So, you're not  working at all.  There's no side job,  remote jobs?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              (<u>3:05 Unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    And you haven't been in any kind of work  along the trip.  I know some people work  at bars or hospitals or anything like that.</p>
                    <p>David:              No.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    We've thought about it, but sort of it  almost seems like for now you get paid here.   It doesn’t, you know, if you're going to make $2.00 an hour, you know,  it's not really worth it in a lot of ways to…</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              No,  it's too….</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    I'd rather go home and make more money and  save, and come back.</p>
                    <p>                        Do  you guys have a daily budget you planned on or you try to work for?</p>
                    <p>David:              Yes.</p>
                    <p>Interviewee:    What's  that if you don't mind sharing.</p>
                    <p>David:              Well...not,  that's quite important.  Our budget for  all our travels is about $150 a day, but that's before we start planning a  trip.  So, if we have to book and airfare  before hand, that comes off.  If we have  to book travel insurance, that comes off.   So on this trip, because we actually have <strong>(</strong><u>4:07 unintelligible</u><strong>) </strong>flights (<u>unintelligible</u>)  miles, our budget is about $120 a day, but that's too much.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              That's  too much.</p>
                    <p>David:              We  don't need (<u>unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   We've actually been doing it, plan on $100 a day, and then in Belize, it's more, because Belize is more expensive.  Other places it's been less, but yes.</p>
                    <p>David:              But  we're averaging probably about $80 a day.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Okay, cool.   And you've been sort of - you've been able stick to that or be under  that.</p>
                    <p>David:              Sorry?</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    You've been under that.  You just said you've been under…</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    As so, this last trip, how long were you  planning it, like, how – before you left?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Gosh,  more than a year actually.  I mean  actually to be honest, we booked the flights a year before.</p>
                    <p>David:              Ten  months before.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Ten  months before, yes, that's true.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So, you've been thinking about it and (<u>4:58 unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              You  know, give this is our life plan, you know, there's a spreadsheet on here that  has our plans for the next five years (<u>unintelligible</u>)  because that's - we're always thinking, it's changing as well.  But, we're always planning ahead and meeting  about it and (<u>5:12 unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    And so, you basically just saved money ahead  of time.  That was sort of retirement.</p>
                    <p>David:              (<u>Unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p>Crosstalk</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Before you gave up work, you figured out you  needed a certain amount for…</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              We  did, yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Okay.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              And  you know, I think, as we said, the key thing there was paying off our mortgage,  because the mortgage, so that's you're biggest outgoing.</p>
                    <p>David:              But,  what really characterizes situation is we don't have children.  We live a fairly modest lifestyle.  We have a nice life, but we live a fairly  modest life.  So actually the amount of  money we saved was not as much as most people think we have, because we don't  need to leave any money and it doesn’t matter if we have pensions when we're  older.  So, actually, there's not that  much money.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    And you said something about you spend less  here than when you're at home.</p>
                    <p>David:              We  do.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    You told me before you spend more per day or  per month.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Yes.  The U.K. is expensive to live in, so  just doing your food shopping is expensive.   But we do definitely save money from being at home.</p>
                    <p>David:              The  budget in the U.K.  is the same, but we spend sometimes a little more.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So basically, to you guys, it doesn’t matter  where you are.  You're spending more or  less the same amount.</p>
                    <p>David:              Yes.  Our budget per months for 12 months is fixed.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              But  generally, we go home – (<u>6:39 unintelligible</u>)  went home with a chunk, and we will this year as well.</p>
                    <p>David:              Yes,  and of course when you're at home, you build up more of the things you need to  buy so, it all balances out.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   You don't have obviously like cell phone bills or…</p>
                    <p>David:              We  do.  We keep that going.  We keep utilities going.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Is there anything else you cancel?  Like, when we left, we cancelled our  cable.  We gave up our apartment, so we  cancelled our cable, our car insurance, our cell phone bills, Internet  bills.  Do you have a car at home?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Yes,  in a garage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So, did you cancel the insurance on that or  no?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              We  just get someone to go to check it out (<u>7:16  unintelligible</u>), there's nothing.</p>
                    <p>David:              Well,  we freeze our gym membership, so that saves us a little bit of money.  We freeze two or three (<u>7:25 unintelligible</u>) which saves probably no more  than $150.  (<u>Unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So, it sounds like the key for you guys in a  nutshell is like you spend the same here (<u>7:37  unintelligible</u>).  So, it  doesn't matter where you are.</p>
                    <p>David:              Yes.  Over 12 months, the average is the same.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              I  think for us it's quite funny, because we do tell people, especially family  members that (<u>7:50 unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p>David:              Yes,  because people think you have loads of money, but it's not true.  So they think you've…</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Because you're traveling the world and…</p>
                    <p>David:              They  think you've won some lottery or something, and you're not working.  But what it is, it's risk.  We just decided to take the risk of not  working and (<u>8:07 (unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So, my next thing I think about then is, I  mean, you guys are fairly young to retire.   Did you have fairly good jobs before (<u>8:16  unintelligible</u>) under 60 (<u>unintelligible</u>).  I mean, do people retire before 60 at home?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              No,  we had good jobs (<u>unintelligible</u>).  We have excellent pensions.  We both have excellent pensions, so that's  what's enabled us to do it actually.</p>
                    <p>David:              But  I think they were only good jobs.  They  were good jobs, but they were good jobs if you believed enough was enough.  If you believe you just want more and more  and more, then no, these jobs wouldn't have been enough.  People would have wanted more and more and more.  For us, they were good enough to go to (<u>8:56 unintelligible</u>)</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    You said (<u>Unintelligible</u>)  pension, and I don't – I mean, I don't – in the U.S., I don't know if that's (<u>unintelligible</u>) any more.</p>
                    <p>David:              We  have a different – you have a 401(k).  We  have company pensions, so servicing companies gives you a pension, so it's  different.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    I know some companies - like my mom, I think  gets that because she worked for a government agency or something like  that.  But, is that common the U.K.  for most companies?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              When  you're working for a private company, (<u>9:19  unintelligible</u>), and the ones that we worked for (<u>unintelligible</u>).   Can we also say the business about the house as well.  I mean, just to go back a little bit in the  section.  You know, the important part for  us was making a decision that we didn't want a bigger and bigger house, (<u>unintelligible</u>), so that was real important to  us.  We made that decision probably about  15 years ago that what we had was good enough.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Because your how is paid off.</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              But  it's not huge, but it was making that decision that it was enough and we didn't  need to keep going higher and higher, and bigger and better.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    But, I guess what I was saying is that  because of that, you were able to pay it off.   You said you don't have a mortgage.</p>
                    <p>David:              Yes.  That's true, but I think people who want  bigger houses (<u>unintelligible</u>) obviously  children with education, they want bigger cars and so on any (<u>unintelligible</u>) probably the sorts of people who  want five-star hotels.  So, this is –  what's we're talking about is not the way they would do it.</p>
                    <p>                        So,  I think modesty is something that is the common thread.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    So, and that – one the questions is how much  do you spend per day on lodging in general here at this hotel?</p>
                    <p>David:              We  try and average $30 the whole trip.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes, and does that work?</p>
                    <p>David:              We  probably, at the moment, less than $35, because Mexico was a little bit more  expensive.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              (<u>10:42 Unintelligible</u>)</p>
                    <p>David:              But  I think it will work about right.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    I think our most expensive day was the first  day we got to Cancun, and we spent $48.  We booked it online, had no idea <u>(10:53 unintelligible</u>) and then after that, maybe  one day at $40.  In general, I think we  spent under $30 almost every day.</p>
                    <p>David:              And  we always will have a private room with a balcony.  So, we – and often, we (<u>unintelligible</u>) so we would not stay in a  dormitory.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Right.   This is, I think, only our second dormitory, but in general, yes, we'd  get a private room, $15 to $30.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              We've  had - we've done lots of $20-$25.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes, $20-$25.</p>
                    <p>David:              But  again, our most expensive was the same as you.   You might be right, because we booked it in advance.  So, it was four or five night in Mexico City, which was  about $50, maybe a bit more.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    I think the thing in that that we found is  that the places that are cheaper, like here, they don't have – you can't book  it online or you can't even find it online.   Maybe you can, but we couldn't find much online.</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p>David:              …in  essence, because we booked this by telephone.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Did anybody – before you guys left, and I've  guess you've been traveling (<u>11:51 unintelligible</u>)  did anybody try to dissuade you, like don't go because of danger, or money, or  you're crazy or…?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Oh,  it's an old chestnut with my mother any time we go anywhere.  &quot;Oh, it's dangerous there.&quot;, but  that's not informed, you know, that's just maternal feelings.  But no, I don't think anybody other than  her.  I think generally, folks know we've  been traveling for a while and understand why we do it, and generally they're  with us.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   We definitely had a lot of people – we were planning on driving  first.  You know, a lot of people just  telling us, especially in Mexico.  I mean, I had a guy, he actually really  scared me.  He had a friend was  supposedly doing all this research in Mexico and he looked at me and  said, &quot;What are you trying to prove?   Are you trying to prove you're macho to drive through Mexico?&quot;  And, I think it would have been fine.  Our car ended up breaking down before we  left.</p>
                    <p>David:              In  our earlier traveled, people did have more concerns.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              When  we were younger.</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p>David:              They're  more used to us just going off now.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   Okay.  I think that's all of the  questions.  So, this part is just for my  information if I want to contact you later, or if you want anything included if  this ever becomes a book, I have no idea.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Well  yes.  I mean, will you send it to us  before you publish anything though?</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   What I was going to say is I can send it to you before, you can look at  it and then…if it ever turns into anything, I'm happy to send you guys like a  free PDF copy of everything.</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p>David               ….this  is one of your case studies, then fine.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes, that'd be great.</p>
                    <p>David:              Then  we (<u>13:41 unintelligible</u>).  So, do you have our email address?</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    That's what I was going to put in here.  So, your full name is…how do you spell your  name?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Fiona  Tiffin.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    And you're email…</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Is  dandf – the same as the name - <a href="mailto:.tiffin@btinternet.com">.tiffin@btinternet.com</a>.  (<a href="mailto:dandf.tiffing@btinternet.com">dandf.tiffing@btinternet.com</a>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Do you have like a – oh, you do have a blog  or a Website.  What was that?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Yes.</p>
                    <p>David:              And  you wouldn't publish it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    No, this is your – all of this stuff I'm  just going put just for my (<u>14:19 unintelligible).</u></p>
                    <p>David:              …is  www.travelingtiffins.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Yes.  I mean, the thing about that blog is it's  just – it's really for family and friends, and there aren't even any keywords  or Meta, whatever they are, in the…</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes.   No, this is just so I can find you.</p>
                    <p>David:              <a href="http://www.travelingtiffins.co.uk/">www.travelingtiffins.co.uk</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Oh, .co.uk. (<u>14:49  unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Now, is there any other things you thought  were interesting or…?  Any other  questions you would have asked or felt would be good?</p>
                    <p>David:              <u>(15:04 unintelligible</u>) age is important.  I want to say when people start (<u>unintelligible</u>).   You asked about when we started thinking about this trip.  For some it's a way of life, like with us,  and it's how that way of life evolved.   For example, we finished – we decided to finish work four years ago when  I was laid off, which was conveniently laid off.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Engineered  layoff.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    <u>(15:33  unintelligible</u>) actually about four days a week.</p>
                    <p>David:              And  we've been – our transition was to go do two years voluntary service in Nepal,  so Peace Corp time voluntary service.  So  for the first two years, we actually didn't spend anything because we didn't  earn anything, and we had a wonderful experience.  And then came back from that and then, we (<u>15:54 unintelligible</u>) traveling.  So – and the plan for that started about…</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              1997-98  was when we paid off the house.  That's  when we decided that…</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    I think you had said you had traveled  somewhere.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              We  went to India,  yes.  We went to India in '97.  That was – and then we took a year out to  travel, and that was really…</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    How did you do that, because – or at least  to me, that's more relevant, because I'm not obviously, at the age I'm ready –  how did you do that year?</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Well,  we were giving up careers.  It didn't  cost a huge amount of money.  Do you  remember how much it cost?  You do, don't  you, 10,000 pounds?</p>
                    <p>David:              Twelve  thousand pounds.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Twelve  thousand pounds for year.  And you know,  it was really leaving – I mean, David left the Army so it was a big career  change, and he was going to do an MBA, had his place.  So, it was just – it was the perfect time  slot for us to do that.</p>
                    <p>David:              That  year, by the way, was just – we averaged $5 a night for accommodations, (<u>16:46 unintelligible</u>) what was for breakfast, and  always with a (<u>unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              So  yes, a bit younger then, and that just – and it also gave me a big change in  terms of career.  It allowed me to  settle, because obviously David had been in the Army, so I'd been following him  around.  So, it allowed me to sort of  settle into a good job, so that was great for me.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    You had enough money, though, saved for a  year.  I mean, 12,000 pounds, still I  mean, a lot for year if you're not working.</p>
                    <p>David:              Well,  I had – half of that was from a grant I had to leave the Army, and the rest I  think we borrowed actually.  Yes, because  around that time, doing an MBA as people do in America, they borrow a lot of money  to do their MBA.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Right.</p>
                    <p>David:              So  we ended up with quite a – (<u>17:31 unintelligible</u>)  do that.  Maybe we had it.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              I  think we had it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    You more or less saved the money before you  left.  And then when you came back…</p>
                    <p>David:              We'll  start to study straight away.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Okay.   So, a big piece of the key for you here, leaving a job and knowing you  were going to do something new.</p>
                    <p>David:              (<u>17:52 Unintelligible</u>) Yes.  So it was a risk, and we left the jobs.  Obviously, I then went into a year of then  not earning more money (<u>unintelligible</u>)  business school.  Fiona got a job.  And then the risk was that I would get a  decent job at the end of business school.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Right, which doesn't sound like too much of  a risk, you would think after…</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p>David:              Yes,  it was 1981…</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p>David:              It  was a very tricky time, but got a job, a good job, and went from there.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              The  other thing, just if I can get my thoughts straightened out, this is what I was  saying yesterday about this perception of what it's all about.  You know, you've made the point that people  have to want to do it.  It's a mindset  thing that's up here, and maybe some previous experience, but this idea about  the cost of it all, I think that's maybe quite an important point that people  think it costs loads of money, because they're applying their own country's  standards, their cost of living standards to other places.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Or even just the hotels.  I mean, most people are not used to a place  like this.  I mean, there's private  rooms, private bathrooms, it's nice, but there's also like hostel rooms that  bring, so the whole thing just brings down the price.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Exactly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:     Although, the same point that you standards  are definitely not the same.  I mean, just  things people getting used to, like putting toilet paper in the garbage is sort  of like totally crazy to a lot of people.   It was kind of weird to us the first week or to.  So yes, and definitely even other hotels  we've been in and stuff, $30 a night is less – it's not even the same standard  to some degree as like Motel 6.  Some  things are way better, like the garden and the hammocks.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              But  then there's the other thing, which is this lovely expression, being not doing,  because people go on holiday and often, they'll go to beaches and they'll lye  on the beach, or they'll go and do things.   They're visiting, doing thing within their two-week holiday or whatever.</p>
                    <p>                        But,  I think the other thing that needs this sort of mindset change is you can't do  it all the time when you're traveling for a protracted period.  So, the fact that you are just sitting – we  had a lazy day yesterday.  We read lots,  we did (<u>20:07 unintelligible</u>) on the  computer, we (unintelligible).  So days like that are great days, because you  just be.  You're relaxing, and they're  okay.  And, I think that was also a  little bit early on, it was quite difficult to sort of say, actually it's okay  not to do anything in a day, unless maybe it was something that people would  appreciate (unintelligible).</p>
                    <p>David:              (<u>Unintelligible</u>) just struck me, there might be a  discussion (<u>unintelligible</u>) about (<u>unintelligible</u>) the key ingredients (<u>unintelligible</u>).   Because suddenly I remember, when we did our first year while traveling,  nobody we knew, friends, said they could do the same thing.  They all said we could do that, because we  could spend every minute of a year with each other.  I think it's a key thing.  I mean, if you are totally comfortable with  the person you travel with…a year, I mean we used to joke.  The only time we were apart was when we went  to the toilet, the only time in the whole year we were apart.  And the only big decisions of the day were  where were you going to sleep and where are you going to eat, because for the  rest of the time, it's companion – a lot of the time, it's companion  silence.  You've got a 12-hour bus ride.  It can be quite – you don't talk all the time  do you, so you have to be very comfortable.</p>
                    <p>                        And,  I (<u>21:29 unintelligible</u>) we couldn't  spend all that time with each other.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Interesting.   That definitely – my mom and one of their friend's who is their  psychologist said that's definitely a thing to look at and watch, and it's hard  to spend all the time, because there's nobody else and you have to depend on each  other.  You know, but if you get in a  fight, then there's nowhere else for you to go.   I mean, you can but you're in a strange city, and nobody else is around,  so they were both you know more or less impressed on our ability to do it, even  though (<u>22:03 unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              Well  you know, inevitably, you can have – there are going to be little bits of  tension aren't there, but generally, that's – it's a really key point.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Good.   Cool, thank you very much.</p>
                    <p>Fiona:              You  want to give us your email?  If we think  of anything we'll (unintelligible).</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:    Yes, I will do that.</p>
