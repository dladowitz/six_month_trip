                    <p class="style7">Nick Wray, 32yrs, Accountant</p>
                    <p>I met Nick in El Salvador and then we crossed paths again in Guatemala where we both ended up living and volunteering for a few months. Both of us spent time taking spanish lessons in Antigua, Guatemala, though Nick was truely dedicated to the subject. Nick is truly an interesting guy and good friend, who seems to have big dreams of continuing to travel. Last I heard he was in Panama City Panama.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, this is our book that may or  may not become a book on how people finance their travel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               How they finance it?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Well, so the point - my hope or  purpose is that Americans especially, like, are freaked the fuck out on  traveling for more than two weeks at a time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               All right.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Well, that's the point, because  part of it is cultural – like, your jobs don't give you more than two-three  weeks off, and another part is how do you finance it?  I think - how do you finance six months of  travel?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               You save up.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Well, that's – yes.  See, that's the point.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It depends.  Oh yes, and it's more than I spent in my  life.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Well okay.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               In my general day-to-day  spending.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay, so maybe there's a key right  there.  In the U.S., I think many, many  people spend more than they earn, which is why the credit industry is so huge  in the U.S., which is why everybody's fucked right now, because the credit  industry's all fucked up.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               And I'm completely the opposite,  and so I've kind of never – I spend within my means.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Always…simply.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But it's not kind of through  choice.  It's just through kind of  natural kind of habit or – not so much habit, just my kind of general  persona.  I kind of do what I want to do,  and I don't kind of – I'm not exorbitant.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             For me, I mean I would like to  spend more than I make, but I feel like when you owe money, there's this big  pressure.  Like, I actually just got out  of all my credit card debt, like, eight-nine months ago, and when you have to  pay a credit card debt and you…</p>
                    <p>                        Like,  I was in this place where I was – not – okay, I wasn't working to pay off my  credit card, because I was – but in a sense, every month I had to pay $100 or  $200 towards your credit card, and you sort of – you can't stop working because  then how do you pay these debts, you know, which is I think very big in the  United States.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But, you also kind of choose to  make those debts in the first place as well.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right, of course.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               And you're accepting the  consequences.  I've never had a credit  card debt.  Okay, occasionally sometimes  I get 300 pounds, (2:24 <strong>unintelligible</strong>)  comes in and I pay it off immediately and that's it.  I've got a student loans debt and I still  probably owe kind of 3,000 or 4,000 grand, but because I'm not earning, it's <strong>means distance.  I can – I don't even </strong>have to pay it  off.  (2:39 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) only gave about 25,000 grand.  So kind of – I don't really need to pay  it.  Otherwise, I have no debts.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, I think…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But it's same six – when I  finished the university, I went traveling then and all the student loans that  took out, I spent kind of maybe 1,000 pounds out of 8,000.  So, I had 7,000 grand left.  I earned enough in the summer and didn't  spend ridiculous amounts of money when I was at the university, so I had 7,000  pounds and I went shopping on that.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But do you – is that a common  philosophy in the U.K.  or no?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               No.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             I'm guessing it's not, because I  think the U.K. is the same  as the U.S.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I think I'm kind of – I'd only  get - maybe (<strong>unintelligible</strong>) it's actually  the same, but it may be not quite as extreme, but I think (<strong>unintelligible</strong>) many people as much as me.  Though, if they got money then they'll spend  it.  But the thing is, you spend your  money and what have you got to show for it here…nothing.</p>
                    <p>                        Whereas,  I managed to go away traveling for kind of seven – like, ten months and I  didn't even spend the whole 7,000 grand.   When I went back home and (<strong>unintelligible</strong>)  I still got a bit of money left.  And  that's without budgeting.  That's just  you know, you spend what you need to spend, and you don't spend what you don't,  and you just make conscious decisions on whether something's good enough or  worth spending a lot of money on or it's just….</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, the key – okay, so how long  have you been traveling so far?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Five weeks.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And how long is your plan, more  of…?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I guess I got another six months,  no…seven months – just over seven months in (4:16 <strong>unintelligible</strong>).</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And so the key…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But I have no budget constraints.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right.  Well, okay.   When you say no budget, like, how do you have enough money to spend –  how do you have seven months worth of money without – did you save, did you –  like, how do you have seven months?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I did save without trying to  save.  I've pretty much saved about 1,000  pounds a month when I was back in the U.K. once I paid off my car  loan.  And then, a couple of weeks ago,  my brother sold my car for me, so that was another 5,000 grand.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But 5,000 grand in pounds?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Five grand in pounds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But because I don't have family,  kids, and a mortgage, so I had nothing absorbing my money apart from maybe 130  pound a month paying off my student loan, and that was it.  So, everything else I own is kind of (5:11 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) so I just kind of spend  as I need to.  I go out, I do whatever I  want, and then there's money left over.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, for you though, the key – like  what allowed you to travel for seven months is that you more or less saved  1,000 British pounds a month for…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Not through choice.  I just happened.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But it's still a choice.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It just happened I saved.  I just don't spend money because I've got  money.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So you didn't actually try, you  just – by your lifestyle…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I live my lifestyle as I need to  and then I end up…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So either you spend - just sort of  I don't know, not by accident, but by your lifestyle, you've make more than you  spend just by – based on whatever your job is versus how much you spend.  Because, so, many people could make as much  as you and spend twice as much, or make less than you and spend half as  much.  It just depends on…right?  Am I getting that right?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Well, yes.  But I guess also, with my job, I was too busy  and I traveled a lot, and so, when I'm traveling, kind of I'll be away probably  half – 50% of the time I'd be away, so within that week, I'd have no expenses  costs.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right, so – and if this map…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               So, there's no cost to me.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             If this map works out, you're  saying more or less – well, how – do you have a daily budget that you spend  when you're traveling?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               No, I've made no budget, nothing.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But, do you know more or less how  much – I mean, you can't spend $40,000 in a month while you're traveling,  right?  Like, I mean…do you know more or  less?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I look – then because - also  because when I was in Antigua, it was kind of controlled by the fact that I was  at school, so I was paying $160 a week and that's kind of<strong> </strong>all my meals a week apart from Sundays.  I'm not going out that much because I'm  studying because I want to get as much out of school as I can.  So, I'm kind of not spending too much as a  consequence, and the fact that I'm at school and trying to learn Spanish, not  because I'm choosing not to spend, but because my reason for being there is to  learn Spanish.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Would you say when you're  traveling, like $150.00 – or $250.00 a week sounds right or…more or less, or  within…you know.  I mean, I'm just trying  to get – like, I'm trying to figure out what people spend.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I spend – I think what I'm – I  think I'd spent maybe about 800 pounds in a month.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay.  So, we're talking about – I'm talking U.S.  here.  So that's like $16…$1,300.00.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               $1,200, maybe $1,100-$1,200.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay, a month.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             In a month, but that was because  I'm at school, so I'm not doing much extra stuff.  I'm just going to school (8:00 <strong>unintelligible</strong>).</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And you're at a home stay where you  get your meals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Home stay so I'm not spending much  extra cash on food or anything apart from Sundays, so there's not much extra  expenditure.</p>
                    <p>                        But  then that also takes into account kind of (8:14 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) so I'm kind of starting going out a bit more, <strong>kind of in Christmas and New Year, and then  buying presents for </strong>kind of the family and teacher and stuff.  It's a bit tough, because I have no budget  constraints, because I know myself that I'm – if I need to spend something then  I'll spend it.  If I don't need to, I  won't spend it and if something's worthwhile doing, then I'll do it.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Are you worried about like let's  say after five months, are you worried that you'll have to go home and figure  out more money or you'll just do it when it happens?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Well, I'm not going to run out of  money within seven months, but my thing is I don't want to go home with nothing  left.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But you said if you spend – well, I  guess I don't know in British Pounds.   You said $1,100-$1,200 in U.S.  Is there – well, you said about – you say you  saved about 1,000 British Pounds…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               A month.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, that would be 7,000 - seven  months more or less, right?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               If I'd saved – well, pretty much  over two years.  I've – if you want (9:15 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) probably saved about  25,000 grand.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             In British Pounds?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               In a couple of years at my job.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay.  So you would spend that before you have to go  home and make more money.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But I don't want to spend all  that, because then I'd kind of had a long haul day, maybe I learned Spanish,  right, but I've got nothing.  So, I want  maybe a deposit for a house or something to start a business with or maybe  money to invest in property in Argentina  or…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, here's the other question that…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               So I'm not planning on spending  it all, but I have no reason – I don't have a use for that money yet, you know?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right.  The other question I have, I've been noticing  with a couple of people I talked to is that – I hate to lead the witness with  this, I guess I will.  Do you think you  spend more or less money here or at home for a month, in a month or two months  or three months?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Definitely less, because for  example, a month's rent I was paying in Bristow was 350 Pounds exclusive of the  bills.  And so, 350 Pounds, that's $500  maybe, and that's without food or anything else, and without going out  drinking.  So it's easily more at home.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But then also, I'm earning a  shitload more.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Because you're not learning anything  (10:36 <strong>unintelligible</strong>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               So, when you're kind of not  earning, then you're kind of restricting your spending as well.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But then, I'm not even thinking  about restricting (<strong>unintelligible</strong>)  not spending (<strong>unintelligible</strong>).  It's not like if you've got money available  to get drunk every single night, would you get drunk every single  night…no.  That's not good for you, and I  don't want it.  It's kind of difficult to  kind of narrow it down, because I don't have a budget, I don't have a plan, I  don't have any particular reason.  If  something's worth doing, then I'll do it, and if not, then (11:11 <strong>unintelligible</strong>).</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But I mean, in general, you know  you have enough saved that it's not that big a deal.  You're not…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Ideally, yes.  Maybe I'd like to restrict it to kind of on  average 1,000 grand a month, so seven months, I spent 7,000 pounds, after the  wedding, I get about 200 a day, I can work for three-four months in the U.K.,  save up 7,000 grand and that's paid for my trip, and then I'll go away again,  and I'm in the same position financially as I was at the start, but I've got  Spanish under my belt, and now I have a load of experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             That's – I mean, that's, for me,  was the thing.  There was two things I  mean, I told Teresa I don't want to happen on our trip, like I'm worried  about.  These are the only two things I'm  going to care that – I'm going to try to prevent happening.  One was any kind of physical violence to us.  Like, I don't care if people rob all our  stuff, steal our stuff, whatever.  That's  – I'm – we're both prepared for that.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               You only take things with you  that you – that matters.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Exactly.  And the second one is I don't want to go into  debt.  Those are the only two  things.  Like, I don't want to end up  being $10,000 – owing $10,000 that I have to work off, in two – I'm not going  to say those are equal.  I'd rather have  to be in debt than have physical violence happen to us, but those are the only  two things I more or less am trying to prevent from happening.</p>
                    <p>                        But  yes, like you said, like, to have the money and when you're done not to go into  debt or not to sort of waste everything you have.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But, the other – that's the  thing, because I've enough money for doing something I don't like, which maybe  I didn't know at the time, but which kind of makes that money worth more than  earning money through what you do enjoy, because otherwise, there's no point in  saving up the past five years in my life.   Because, I don't want to – difficult to say.  I wouldn't - I'm not happy with my life if  I'm leading a life that I don't like or I'm doing a job I don't like, and I'm  just breaking even.  So, I'm just kind of  living and in a job I don't like, and my living costs meet what I'm  earning.  So, I'm not enjoying my job,  not particularly enjoying my life, and I'm getting nothing from it.  But, the last five years - okay, the first  three years I didn't make anything, but I got qualified and then within two  years, I've saved up a load of money – I haven't liked it, but at least I've  got something from it, and then this is more about experience rather than just  spending the money I have.  It's  experience to choose what I want to do next and to use whatever money I have  left to realize what I want to do.  I  just don't know what it is yet.  And  therefore, I have no budget constraints, I don't restrict myself to anything,  but I'm not going to go overboard and spend ridiculously because I kind of  don't know what the future may hold.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Did you – when you…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It's very open, you know.  I don't…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             When you left home, you said you  sold your car or you recently sold your car.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I tried to sell my car, got let  down right at the end the day before I left, and then my brother sold it, yes  about a week ago for me.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Did you turn off – did you get rid  of any – So, I assume you obviously got rid of insurance before you left, like  your car insurance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Car insurance, yes.  That was all cancelled and stuff, so I  basically had no bills.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             What about – so did you have an  apartment you rented?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               That was cancelled two months  before I finished my job and then I stayed – I moved close – back to – close to  where I worked into a friend's house who was – who's in Africa and so I kind of  looked after my friend's house and paid like a minimal – she didn't want  anything, but I then I gave her money – well, I would have paid her because  it's not right to stay somewhere for free, so I kind of paid her money, and  obviously less then what I would have been, saved on the front spot, (15:12 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) so I saved money  through my last two months because I knew I was leaving work anyway, so it was  all about saving money then.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Like other – did you cancel other  bills?  I know, like obviously, heating,  air condition, you didn't pay for.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               There really wasn't much  else.  Once I left my flat, then kind of  all utility bills and stuff don't really count.   I didn't have to pay any utility bills for the last two months of where  I stayed at my friend's, because that was already covered.  Phone bill – mobile phone, I cancelled on my  kind of  the last day at the airport (15:46 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) and that's  cancelled, and…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             What about – did you - where'd you  put like your – the rest of your stuff?   Like, I don’t know, you have a bed or a TV or…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Furniture I gave to my aunt.  She had an empty flat and so kind of worked  out perfect for her, because she had some bad tenant who – a couple of tenants  who kind of ruined the flat and stuff and everything, (16:09 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) all out, and so the timing  was perfect.  So I had a load of  furniture that I just gave to my aunt, so that went to a good home.  And then, the few other bits that I had, they've  gone – I had a (16:22 <strong>unintelligible</strong>)  table that went to mate in London.  It's all about giving things to a good  home.  So, that went to a friend's, and  then the other possessions, they've just gone to my parents' house in  storage.  And otherwise, I had a car that  got sold.  Otherwise, I don't really have  too much else.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And as far as your job, basically,  you were tired of your job, so you left.   You decided to…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I suppose tired.  I thought about – I kind of already knew  before I started my job that it wasn't really what I wanted to do.  I'll give it a chance and after six months, I  kind of still knew it wasn't what I wanted to do, but gave it a bit more  chance, and then after two years, I just thought well – I kind of kept going  because I didn't know what else to do.   And eventually, I'd had enough, hadn't thought about anything else to do,  because I kind of didn't have time to think about anything else to do, so I  just told my boss that I wasn't happy, wasn't happy with my life, and he could  pay me twice as much as he was, and I still would've never stayed because I'm  not happy with my lifestyle.  It's not  about the money.  And so I quit and having  time out to travel and think and choose what I want to do next.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, that's sort of – actually it's  interesting, because that's more or less what I did, but I haven't talked to  anybody about this part.  Like, did you –  like for me, I realized I was going to quit, and then I started interviewing  for new jobs, and then I decided – wait a minute, before I go get a new job, I  should – because I'm just going to be at this new job for three, four, five  years, I should do something for six months, because when else in America –  when else do you get six months off?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Exactly.  Yes.   My whole thing is, - well, I'm changing careers, so it doesn't matter  how much time I take in between one job and the next job, because you're  starting from the same point, and the only difference if I take six months or  one year, is when I retire, it'll be six months or a year later when I retire.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Or not, who knows?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Whether I retire early or not.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But who knows whether that six  months could get washed out or whatever.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Exactly, so I've got nothing to  lose by taking time out and traveling.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Did you like think about like oh, I  should do something else.  I should go  take time off and then think about it for a month or two, or how did you sort  of come to that decision, and then tell your boss or decide that that's going  to happen, you're going to do this?   Because at least, again, for people in the States, I guess it's crazy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               My first thing was to decide that  I didn't want to work.  I didn't want the  same job, so, it took a while to tell my boss that I didn't want to work for  him anymore.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Like a while, like a month or a  week or three days?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It was kind of over 6 months of  thinking about – maybe 6 months, 12 months of not being happy with my job, and  so, it's more the realization of definitely it's not right.  But the difficult thing is because I didn't  know what to do, it's hard to kind of quit without anything ahead.  But…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Or money coming in, more or less,  at least for me it would be, not anything ahead, just the money part of it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It was not so much the money,  because I'm so flexible with kind of my lifestyle.  I have no real commitments, so I can kind of  do what I want.  And there's always the  free option of going home and living with parents with no costs, because  they'll always welcome me home.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right, which is exactly what I  have.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               So, it's not the money costs, really,  and it depends<strong> (20:01 unintelligible) </strong>have  an income, because I don't need – if I haven't got any income, well, I could  stay at home and I can read and I've got no costs, you know, so I don't need  money coming in to exist.</p>
                    <p>                        But  it was – well, if I'm going to quit my job, well, surely I should know what I  want to be doing.  But after six months  of not knowing that I want to do, well, I've got to change something because  I'm not happy.  So in that case, well,  I'm going to quit my job and give myself time – put myself in another situation  to give myself more a chance of finding something I want to do, because you  can't just keep going on thinking, &quot;Oh, I want to do something else and I  don't know.&quot;  Six months later,  well, I want to do something else but I don't know.  It just – you've got to do something about  it.  Otherwise there's always a  &quot;what if&quot; or you're not happy with your own life.  You haven't done anything about it yourself,  so your own life is in your own hands.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, do you think – and this is  something that I haven't heard from anybody else – do you think this trip for  you is to find something new to do or no?   And I haven't heard that from anybody else, and again…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It's not to find something for me  to do.  It's giving me an opportunity to  at least try other things and so this trip is not to see lots of things.  So, it's not to go and do lots of (21:19 <strong>unintelligible</strong>).  Surfing, yes because I'm learning something and  it's something that I want to do.  But,  say going to – my trip is not about seeing lots of things, it's more about  experiences, and so I'd rather meet people, talk to people…learning is the big  deal for me, so if I'm learning Spanish, then I'm happy.  If I'm learning to surf, then I'm happy.  If I'm learning, for example, to play guitar,  then I'm happy because I'm learning things.   I'm developing myself and I'm gaining new experiences.</p>
                    <p>                        But  if I'm just going to do a three-day trip to go and see some monkeys and treck  in the while, and then come back, okay, it might be a fantastic experience, but  I've not learned – I've not advanced or gained anything towards where I want to  be when I'm – not that I know where I want to be, but it's not helped me get  any closer to what would make me happier.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So for me it's not this, but I  don't know if this is (22:25 <strong>unintelligible</strong>).  This whole book thing is maybe to pull out  why people are traveling and how people do it, and I've – maybe something (<strong>unintelligible</strong>) phenomenal will come  out or maybe something crappy will come out, but I almost hear a little bit  maybe in what you're saying is that there's something – you're going to figure  out what you want to do next.  Is that  true or is that not true?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I don't know that I will.  I'm hoping that I will.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay.  So there is some…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               So, I'm giving myself more  opportunity to than I would have back at home.   And also – say for example, I want to learn Spanish, so (22:58 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) learn Spanish.  I want to do some volunteer projects, so I  will be using – at least I'll be giving something back to people and making use  of myself.  But I'm going to be getting  different experiences, so I want to teach some English, so it's going to give  me some classroom experience and it'll give me an insight into teaching stuff,  and so I'll have more idea if maybe I want to be a teacher (23:20 <strong>unintelligible</strong>).  I'd like to do some building construction  work, so I've got more idea about possibly different housing development.</p>
                    <p>                        My  brother's a qualified carpenter, so he spent kind of the last few years doing up  houses, so another idea is (<strong>unintelligible</strong>)  when the housing market's at the bottom, buy a cheap house, and kind of do it  up with my brother.</p>
                    <p>                        But,  how can I really know what I want to do without having at least some experience  in any of these fields.  So, I kind of  need to try lots of different things to get some experiences somewhere to have  more idea of about what I want to choose to do next.  So kind of this – I don't – Central America's  and South America are so much cheaper than home that I can afford to kind of live  cheaply and try lots of different things, and it's not really costing me too  much to get more experiences to make a more kind of informed choice about what  to do next or what to try next.</p>
                    <p>                        But  then it may not all work and I may end up going back home and being an  accountant again.  But, because I'm  qualified I can do that, so I have no financial pressure, because – and then  the day – the worst thing that can happen to me is I end up going back home and  being an accountant again, which I don't like but it's a good, solid  career.  It's a lot better than a lot of  other people have got, and I'm aware of that, but…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, I mean, that's an interesting  thing I see is that I mean how long would it take you to really get back  whatever you had, whatever you know credit card debt you had – it's sounds like  you didn't have any, but for more people…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, I didn't have any debt.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             For having a car payment and having  a rent payment and an Internet payment and an electricity payment, like, how  long would it – or really, how long would it take you to get your job  back?  I mean, that's more or less what…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Pretty much no time, because if  you do things in the right way, life has a way of helping you out.  And so, even though I didn't like my job, I  would always try harder.  I'd work (<strong>25:33 unintelligible</strong>) and it's  recognized, and so my boss would like me to work for him again.  So if I want to go back and I want to go back  to accountancy for a little bit, I know I can get a job with my boss, (25:44 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) work and they all  understand me.  They know I don't really  want to do it, but because I'm an honest, hardworking person, and I'm good at  what I do, and there is work available for me.   So, there's kind of no risk in my life.   There's no risk in my kind of career if I go back to that.  So, I'm kind of very safe.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Do people in England travel – do they take  three, four, five months off, or is that kind of crazy?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It varies.  Is all depends on circumstance as well.  I think if you've been to a university then  it's a lot easier to, because people who have been to a university don't have  the same commitments.  If – it's maybe a  slight generalization, but they don't have the same commitment as people who  don't.</p>
                    <p>                        For  example, my brother finished school at 16.   He's already married and he's got a 4-year-old boy, and he couldn't –  and he's got a house, and he couldn't take the time off.  He couldn't do any of this, because he's  hasn't got that flexibility, because he's not - because I'm single.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Why couldn't he though?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I have no – because he's got  financial commitments.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             If you were him – see, this is sort  of maybe part of what this book, whatever it is, might – what I think might be  targeted, people like – okay, your brother with a kid and a wife, why couldn't  they?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               On a limited income, so he's…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Could they – is there a way they  could figure it out, is there a way?   Maybe that's what people that I think as Americans that don't think they  can, and I don't know, can they?  Maybe  they can't…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               He has little bit of credit card  debt, but not much, and it's kind of under control.  But, he doesn't earn enough to pay off  quickly, and he's always got his mortgage payments.  I don't think he could. </p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             See, that's what I wonder.  Can – that's – because that's – this is part  of the key.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Because I think because I've  managed myself throughout my – it seems like throughout my life well enough  that I've never got into that.  I've  never made bad decisions financially.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But having a mortgage isn't  necessarily…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               No, not having a mortgage…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Because you could rent it, you  could always rent it.  Well, I don't  know, maybe – I would think you could always rent it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               But he doesn't – he can't save  enough up through a year, and earn what he lives on, what his family lives on,  and so he can't save up any capital.  Well  I wouldn't say capital, but he can't save up any money to do anything really,  anything substantial, and then if he did, his wife doesn't work that much –  enough to earn much either.  So, there's  no money available to do anything like this unless they kind of took out a big  credit card loan (<strong>28:40 unintelligible</strong>)  put it on credit.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right, I think this is what the  majority of Americans are afraid of and I wonder if there's a way around  it.  I don't know what that is.  That's sort of why I'm talking to people, I'm  wondering…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Try spending, always spending  within your means, because people spend too much money, spend much more – I'm –  in a sense, I'm lucky because my family never had much, and so as a kid, I  never had much.  And therefore, I'm used  to not having much.  And so, just because  I earn more, I don't need to spend it.   As I said, because I'm not used to much, I don't need much.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But, wouldn't – couldn't – wouldn't  you say your brother's the same way?  I  mean, he – I don't know.  I assume he  grew up in the same circumstance, but I don't know.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               He just left school at 16, never  did well at school and so, he never had kind of the same education, so the same  opportunities of getting kind of a graduate job and earning as much money as I  do.  And then also having the commitment  of settling down (29:38 <strong>unintelligible</strong>)  he's probably done about 20 jobs and he's – I've done one job, well, two jobs,  but in the same field.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, do you think – or so, maybe the  different – I mean, hearing the difference between you and your brother, and  the ability to do this is one is income – how much you make, two is having a  wife and a kid who you have you have to pay for, which means how much you make  versus how much you spend.  So, it's  really about how much you make versus how much you spend.  Is that right, or not right?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.  And then also, I would also say  circumstances, but that's not really true, because if you want to do something  bad enough, then couldn't – if you have got flexible finances, then you'll find  a way to do whatever you want to do.  If  you want to do something bad enough, then you'd find a way for your whole  family to do it.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And, as an accountant thought, it's  again it's income versus outcome or whatever – inflow versus whatever the term  is.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, I guess it is.  But then, that's only been for me for the  last two years.  I've only had a positive  inflow in the last two years.  But, the  decisions I've made I guess over the last ten years have made me earn enough  over the last two years, and so it's kind of – but then – so I suppose it's  almost always been a long-term plan to go to a university, so kind of get a  good degree, to work hard, not knowing what will come of it, but I've done the  best that I can just because you should always do the best that you can (31:18 <strong>unintelligible</strong>) for whatever reason,  even if you don't know why, you should just do the best that you're capable of  doing.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             I mean, just for me, it – this  whole plan came on maybe seven months ago, and Teresa and I saved for like four  months or something.  Granted a lot of it  was I had about a month's worth of – what's that called – holiday, like paid  vacation…</p>
