                    <p class="style7">Nick Robl, 26yrs, Grad Student</p>
                    <p>I spent time with Nick in two different townin in El Salvador. On specialized in exotic foods. I have a great picture of Nick eating Snake. The other was a little surfing town in El Salvador. We took surfing lessons together and would go out and try our luck for close to a week. What we found is that surfing is hard and we weren't very good. </p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, you're name is <strong>Nick</strong>.   What's your last name?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>                Robl.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And you're 26.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               That is correct.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay.  And right now, where are we right now – we're  in El Tunco.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               El Tunco </p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, how long is this trip that  you're on right now, planned for?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               One month approximately.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             One month.  And, I trying (unintelligible) my questions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I guess you've de-formalized it a  bit.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes.  I had the questions and I don't know what did  I them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I'm a gay traveler too, so.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right.  Okay, so where have you been on this trip so  far?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Let's see, I started in Guatemala  City, went to Antigua, Atitlan, got sick at Atitlan, so I was there for longer  than planned, and then back to Guatemala City, and then up to <u>Tical</u>, and then over to Belize and <u>Caycocker</u>, and back to the <u>Tical</u> area, back down to Guatemala City, and then  to El Salvador.  And then El Salvador, I went to Santa Anna, then to <u>Wahiawa</u><strong>, </strong>and then now here.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And then you leave – you're going  back home in five days, something like that.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Around the 13th or so,  13th or 14th, so…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Cool.  And do you have a daily budget you thought  about before hand or you work on?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               No.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, you just kind of spend  whatever.  So, I think it's worth…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, I just throw money around,  so…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Because I think I told you the  point of – if this ever becomes a book or anything, it's sort of like focused  on how people finance travel to sort of let other people figure out like how  can they do it, how are all the big ways people do it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Well, I just try to find cheap  places.  Like, I don't – you know, kind  of the nicest value, but you know, still at the cheaper end, so like this place  what…$7.00.  The last place was $7 and  that's per night.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Do you think – like, if you had to  make up – what do you think your average spend per day?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               That's a good question.  I guess let's think of – I guess factor in  the bus rides in addition to say renting a surfboard or snorkeling equipment  and stuff, plus room and board, and plus eating, it's got to be – I've got to  be spending $30 to $40 a day.  But, I  could do it a lot cheaper than that if I wanted to.  But, you know, I'm having fun, so…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right.  And your other trips, they were – have they  been for long, because I know you've traveled more than just about anybody else  we've met.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Some of them have been for long  term.  Like, Cambodia, like I said was supposed  to be for a year.  It ended up only being  for three months because of the excessive illness.  And then Seriname<strong>, </strong>I did two runs there, one for about 2½ months and one for about a  month, month and a half.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And on any of those, how did you I  guess pay for them?  Do you have money  that you saved?  I know you said you kind  of worked for someone.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, I work.  And like with the graduate school you get a stipend,  so you get money from that, although anthropology I don't recommend.  You don't get a lot of money from that.  Also, I've taken loans from my parents, and  so they have a running tab going that once I actually have a real job.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Is that more just for living in  general or just specifically for travel?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Kind of a little of both I  guess.  But, yes, and generally, I try to  do it cheaply.  And then like Cambodia,  I was actually working for a company, so they gave me some money.  And had I stayed there the whole time and not  gotten sick, they would have funded like a plane ticket and you know, I didn't  have to pay room and board when I was there.   We had a really nice house.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Because you were working for…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, because I was working for  the company.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Have you ever done any like other  side work?  Like, a lot of people work in  the hospitals or bar as you're traveling?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Unfortunately, no.  If I had stayed in Cambodia longer, I  definitely would have done that, because I was looking into maybe at least  doing something in an orphanage or something, because there was a lot of those  in that area.  And then another friend of  – well, actually we didn't get along that well.   But…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Another person you know.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Another girl I worked with she  actually picked up a job when she was in Cambodia and she worked at a bar  and served drinks, but she got paid very little for that, maybe – she may have  made $10 for a full shift.  So, it wasn't  that great.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             How do you – like, the places that  you stay at, how do you find them?  Because,  one of the things that I think people, at least in the U.S. think about, they  think about travel as more or less traveling to like four or five star places  for a week or two.  And even when we were  looking online, we couldn’t really find prices or anything on how much stuff  was really going to cost.  How do you  find the places you're going to go to?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Well, definitely Lonely Planet is  like kind of the first thing that I look at, and if you get – you know, you get  the books in any bookstore in the states and then they have, I think, a good  baseline.  And then, if you go (<u>6:02 unintelligible</u>), you can kind of go from  there and stuff and talk to other people and see what they found.</p>
                    <p>                        Although  right now, using Central America on a Shoestring I think it leaves out quite a  bit, and I don't think it would hurt to have a guide for each specific country,  just because there's – yes, I just leaves out a lot I guess.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Was that the same for like other  places you've been to?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, more or less the same  thing.  Cambodia we got quite a bit from  Lonely Planet, and actually, since we were living in kind of one set spot,  they'd have like magazines of the city that would come out and tell you all the  different places you could eat and go and the stuff you could see, and all that  stuff.  So, that was also quite useful.</p>
                    <p>                        But  in Cambodia,  the thing was is that you get the Lonely Planet in the states for $20 to  $30.  Over there you show up there and  there's kids everywhere selling those things for like $2 because it's a  knockoff.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             They copy it, yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Although, you've got to be  careful of the knockoffs, because they actually made a joke knockoff that said  like &quot;Go off and pet the Cambodia  kids on the head and rub their hair.   They really like it.&quot;</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Do they really hate that?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.  It's like really bad to touch somebody's head  there.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Interesting.  So when you left home, I guess you didn't go  for that long.  Do you like get rid of  anything?  Or, I guess, do – you say you  put all your stuff in storage or what do you do?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, I keep a bunch of stuff at –  well, a bunch of stuff at my parents' house, but other than that, I try to keep  as little possessions as possible, because I don't like having to move stuff  around and I move quite a bit.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             At home, do you have a car or an  insurance bill, or a cell phone bill or anything like that that you either turn  off and on when you travel?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               No.  That stuff all just keeps going – well,  because again, I haven't gone for long enough.   Before I went to Cambodia,  I was considering selling my truck and stuff that I have right now, because  eventually, I'd like to be vehicle free.   But yes, my mom suggested I not do that because when I come back, I  might need it for graduate school.</p>
                    <p>                        So  yes, I just keep minimal possessions.   And I've been somewhat lucky, because I tend to live with people that  have other stuff too, like furniture and stuff.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And when you go home, like this  time, where are you – do you have a place to stay?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.  I'll – well, right now, I'm living with a  girlfriend and so we have probably the shittiest house in Kent<strong>,</strong> Ohio.   But, we got it because it was like $400 a month rent for both of us  combined, and then – but we have to pay utilities.  But, it was just cheap and economical, and it  was right close to campus, so I can walk to work and stuff, save money on gas  and stuff.</p>
                    <p>                        Well,  and then I'll be living there until – well it looks like now maybe until – if I  get into med school, until I leave for that.  </p>
                    <p>                        Did  I mention I was a gay traveler?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, I think that was the first  thing you said but that you still have a girlfriend at home.  So, is that just while you're traveling?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               No, just…you know, all the time  really.  She's okay with that.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Oh, so do you travel with your  girlfriend at all?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, a few times.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             On like long – over a month trips?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               She – I was in Seriname<strong> </strong>with her for a month or so, and then  also, I went to Costa Rica  with her.  The reason I didn't bring her  here for the entire trip is that she can be a little high strung at times, and  she likes a lot of planning.  With a lack  of schedule and things not always working as planned, I felt like that would be  a stressful endeavor, and we were fighting quite a bit before I left.  So, I thought a few weeks apart would be good  for the relationship.</p>
                    <p>                        Oh  yes, and when we went to Costa    Rica, we had about a 26-mile hike or – no,  sorry, 26-kilometers, but with 65-pound backpacks and stuff, and she about  started crying on that one and was about to just give up or something from the  walking.  But we didn't (<u>10:23 unintelligible</u>) any water or anything, so I  ran ahead and got my pack and then ran back and carried hers for the end of the  walk.  And so, we seem to fight quite  often in that situation, so I thought it would be best if I did this one  somewhat independently.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             <strong>Trish</strong>, do you have any other questions?  Do you remember anything on that list that  I'm sure I missed?  You don't remember  any?  Do you have any other questions  that you thought of?</p>
                    <p>Trish:               What  would be your tips, some travel tips for people traveling as couples (<u>11:03 unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Is this for the book or just for  us?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It think it would be good for the  book too, because people might look into that type of stuff.</p>
                    <p>Trish:               Yes.  Like traveling is really exciting but  stressful at the same time.  (<u>11:18 Unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.  I think probably generate an understanding  ahead of time of your differences and the different things that you want to do,  and kind of target where you go according to like you can both do something  fun, so someone doesn't get stuck sitting around whipping in the hostile while  the other one's out surfing or something.   Sorry, didn't come out right.  I  didn't mean it like that.</p>
                    <p>                        But,  something that if you both can't do it, you can both still have a good time  doing something maybe separately.  And I  would say recognize ahead of time that you won't necessarily do everything  together.  And yes, and like I guess you  guys said, being on top of each other 24/7 gets to be stressful, which is  understandable, so I would say yes, if you can definitely have some stuff that  you can do independently, that might be a good thing.</p>
                    <p>Trish:               But  like, when you were traveling and fighting (<u>12:27 unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               She broke up with me several  times, and I was like, &quot;Well fuck it, I'm going to go out and look for  crocodiles.&quot;  And I knew she was  just being very emotional at the time, so I just – basically, I just go away  and do something on my own for a while.</p>
                    <p>Trish:               And  then it gets better.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.  Eventually, she – you know, generally what  happens is the female eventually comes around and realizes that the male perspective  is usually correct, and then I guess it works out (<u>13:07  unintelligible</u>).  Sorry, that  was quite sexist.  I didn't really mean  that.  But, she was on some weird meds, I  guess at the time, so…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             We'll make sure not to send this to  her.</p>
                    <p>                        Also,  you said a lot of people – I don't know what the word is to call it – other  students at school travel a lot of research.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.  Definitely in anthro if you studied primates,  like that's the thing to do.  And a lot  of people, it seems like they almost go into primatology for that reason so  they can go to the tropics and play in the jungle.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Do they travel for as long a  period, like one or two months at a time, or longer?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Well, for a Masters Degree, you  typically do a shorter amount of travel, so you do like maybe the summer in  between the two years that you – well, the primatology it seems to take quite a  bit longer to get a Masters, which is kind of ridiculous.  But, you go for the summer and then you take  your classes during the regular year.   And so, I went during the summer and then I also went during winter  break.</p>
                    <p>                        But,  when you do a Ph.D., people will go for at least a year.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And how do you think people finance  that?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               They'll write grants and stuff.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So they basically just write  proposals and why they need the money.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               And so they apply – there's stuff  you can get through the university, but then there is other stuff you can get  through bigger agencies, like Sigma Si, and various different ones that will  fund your stuff.</p>
                    <p>                        The  other thing I thought would be a good idea is to look for sponsorships or  something.  Like, I really like the  Solomon shoes that I have, and I wonder if I could write a letter to them and  then say, &quot;I use your shoes everywhere&quot; and have a photo of them in  all different spots and stuff, and say, &quot;these are great shoes&quot; and  then see if maybe they would…  I would  think they would at least give you a pair of shoes and maybe some money or  something for the advertisement.  I don't  know.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, and it's very similar to the  Stride or whatever it is.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, (<u>15:06  unintelligible</u>) runs in place.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So if you were going to travel for  a year and you didn't get grants or something, is that what you think you would  do first, or how would you…?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, I would definitely do  that.  I would write to some companies  for some funding, and then definitely do some – find some way I could do some  work and generate some money.  The other  thing – the other way I get money is I'm still associated with my uncle's  construction company, and so every now and then, they'll get little projects in  that they need done, and they don't have enough time to do it, so they'll ship  it off to me.  And then I can drum the stuff  up and I can generate like $1,000 in a week or so by doing that.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Is that while you're on the road or  just (<u>15:46 unintelligible</u>)?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I do that when I'm back in the  states, because it's like drawing and I need the board and stuff, but I've  picked up quite a bit of extra money from doing that stuff on the side.</p>
                    <p>                        The  other thing, I worked with a girl in Cambodia and she actually – she  went to some of the magazines in the area and they did some freelance  journalism.  And then, I don't think she  had a background in journalism, but she was able to – and she had a reasonable  camera, so she snapped some shots and wrote some articles and then published  it.  And so, you can get some money doing  that as well.  And I think that's a  relatively common for people to do that.</p>
                    <p>                        I'm  trying to think of where else you can get money.  Oh, when I was in West Africa, I actually  prostituted myself because I thought, you know, West Africa is generally safe  in terms of HIV, so that it's probably a good idea to…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Well, that's….</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               And then if you're going to sell  your body, that's the place to do it.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And I'm sure you get a lot -  you get paid well.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes, is paid.  So, the average the salary in West Africa is  maybe $1 a day, so if you think of that, if you're making 10% of their salary  and you sleep with 20 people a day, you're actually like – that's like double  salary (<u>17:15 unintelligible</u>).</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, it's a good perspective, it's a  good angle.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               No, but there's – I mean, and  then online you can find all sorts of organizations like international  jobs.  I think there's like  internationaljobs.com and there's a lot of stuff that will just be for like a  short period of time that you can work somewhere.  So like three months, six months, so I look  at Society for Conservation Biology Website quite a bit, and they have a lot of  stuff on there, ecological stuff.   Primateinfo.net has a number of stuff – volunteer projects.  And some of them you need a background.  Other ones, they just say you need enthusiasm  and stuff.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So they just want you to come and  sort of volunteer and they'll pay for your staying there.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               And initially sometimes, they'll  say you can get room and board for free, but you have to pay for your way to  get here, and it's just somewhat dependent on the organization, what kind of  funding they have, but there's definitely some options out there that will give  you some money.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Cool.  Is there anything else Trish you want to ask?</p>
                    <p>                        Any  other interesting tidbits you want to…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Did I say I was a gay traveler?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, I think so.  I think you said that once.  Alright cool.   Well, maybe this will go somewhere or maybe it will just sit on a hard  drive for five years.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Well, I'm happy to provide you…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Oh, what's your email address so if  we need to talk or contact you?</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               It is <a href="mailto:nickrobl50@gmail.com"><strong>Nick</strong>robl50@gmail.com</a>,  and that's I think I wrote in that book, your little phrase book.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             You said you had a – like that  Website.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               Yes.  I have a Website and a blog too.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Do you want to…</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               I'll write that down, because I  think it's kind of long to say it.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay, yes, so we have it that, we  can keep it all together.  Alright, well  thank you very much.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nick</strong>:               You're welcome.</p>
