                    <p>David and Fiona where a really nice couple we met while staying in a hotel/hostel. We spent time talking about where they'd been and exchanged stories about different Central American cities. They also offered us some very good insights into this book. </p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   First, any of the stuff I'm going to ask you,  if you don't want to answer or whatever, feel free not to answer.  Or, if there's anything that you don't mind  telling me but you don't want us to record later, just let me know that.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Thank you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So, what's you first name?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              David and Fiona.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   David and Fiona.  And what city are you in now?  What city are we in now?  What city is this interview happening in?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>               Juayua, El Salvador.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Let's see, what's today's date.  It's the…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              The 4th of January.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   The 4th of January.  And where are you guys originally from?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              The U.K.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   U.K., what city?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              A village called Silso, north of  London.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Where is that?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Near London.<strong></strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             About 50 miles north of London.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Alright.   I assume you guys are married.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Have been for a long time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes.   And you're traveling…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              So actually, we've been married  for 26 years.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Twenty-six years, okay.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Because actually, that's a funny  story.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Okay.   Yes, I'm asking people if they're single, married or if they're  traveling alone.</p>
                    <p>                        And  you guys, how long have you been traveling for you said already?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             We're in our fifth week.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Five weeks today.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   And how much longer do you have?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Seven.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Seven more weeks.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Three months in total.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Three months in total, and that was the next  question.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              But our plan is to travel for six  months a year, four months in the winter and then up to two months on smaller  trips.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Throughout the summer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   And what's your route so far on this trip?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             So, we arrived in Mexico City and we  worked our way via Oaxaca and down through Belize, into Honduras, and then that  brought us to El Salvador.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Cool.   And that's been two months – or, that's five weeks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             That's five weeks so far.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So, now let's get to how you actually afford  it.  Do you have occupations now or you  said you're retired now?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             We finished work about four years  ago, and prior to that, we were both working in business, general in telecoms  and human resources.  So, we were in that  for a long time, but we made sort of a lifestyle decision in about '97, '98  that we would look to give up work in 2007'ish and then travel.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Okay.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Are you going to ask age?</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Sure.   What's you age?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>              So David is 49 and I'm 47.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              49 and 47.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Do you feel – and were going to put that in,  but I didn't know if people were…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>               You have to.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             It's relevant.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              The story's different for a  younger person.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes.  I  guess I could – I don't know how to ask that without…</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Britt's don't get too upset about  it.  You can do it no problems.</p>
                    <p>Interviewee:    Really.  Yes, that was a thing I…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              You just ask people if they're  comfortable to say it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes.   So obviously, you're not taking any time off because you're not  necessarily working.  So, you're not  working at all.  There's no side job,  remote jobs?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             We do a wee bit of voluntary stuff,  but that’s tiny.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   And you haven't been in any kind of work  along the trip.  I know some people work  at bars or hospitals or anything like that.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              No.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   We've thought about it, but sort of it almost  seems like for now you get paid here.  It  doesn’t, you know, if you're going to make $2.00 an hour, you know, it's not  really worth it in a lot of ways to…</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             No, it's too….</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   I'd rather go home and make more money and  save, and come back.</p>
                    <p>                        Do  you guys have a daily budget you planned on or you try to work for?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes.</p>
                    <p>Interviewee:    What's  that if you don't mind sharing.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Not, that's quite important.  Our budget for all our travels is about $150  a day, but that's before we start planning a trip.  So, if we have to book and airfare before  hand, that comes off.  If we have to book  travel insurance, that comes off.  So on  this trip, because we actually have free flights using miles, our budget is  about $120 a day, but that's too much.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             That's too much.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We don't need it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes.   We've actually been doing it, plan on $100 a day, and then in Belize, it's more, because Belize is more expensive.  Other places it's been less, but yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              But we're averaging probably about  $80 a day.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Okay, cool.   And you've been sort of - you've been able stick to that or be under  that.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Sorry?</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   You've been under that.  You just said you've been under…</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk) Yeah</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   As so, this last trip, how long were you  planning it, like, how – before you left?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Gosh, more than a year  actually.  I mean actually to be honest,  we booked the flights a year before.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Ten months before.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Ten months before, yes, that's  true.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So, you've been thinking about it and…</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             You know, given this is our life plan,  you know, there's a spreadsheet on here that has our plans for the next five  years because that's - we're always thinking, it's changing as well.  But, we're always planning ahead and reading  about it and such.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   And so, you basically just saved money ahead  of time.  That was sort of retirement.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We had the money because we had  given up work.</p>
                    <p>Crosstalk</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Before you gave up work, you figured out you  needed a certain amount for…</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             We did, yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Okay.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             And you know, I think, as we said,  the key thing there was paying off our mortgage, because after the mortgage  there’s not much, so that's you're biggest outgoing.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              But, what really characterizes our  situation is we don't have children.  We  live a fairly modest lifestyle.  We have  a nice life, but we live a fairly modest life.   So actually the amount of money we saved was not as much as most people  think we have, because we don't need to leave any money and it doesn’t matter  if we have pensions when we're older.   So, actually, there's not that much money.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   And you said something about you spend less  here than when you're at home.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We do.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   You told me before you spend more per day or  per month.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Yes.  The U.K. is expensive to live in, so  just doing your food shopping is expensive.   But we do definitely save money from being at home.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              The budget in the U.K.  is the same, but we spend sometimes a little more.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So basically, to you guys, it doesn’t matter  where you are.  You're spending more or  less the same amount.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes.  Our budget per month for 12 months is fixed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             But generally, we go home – last  winter went home with a chunk, and we will this year as well.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes, and of course when you're at  home, you build up more of the things you need to buy so, it all balances out.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes.   You don't have obviously like cell phone bills or…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We do.  We keep that going.  We keep utilities going.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Is there anything else you cancel?  Like, when we left, we cancelled our  cable.  We gave up our apartment, so we  cancelled our cable, our car insurance, our cell phone bills, Internet bills.  Do you have a car at home?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Yes, in a garage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So, did you cancel the insurance on that or  no?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             We just get someone to go to check  it out make sure there's nothing.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Well, we freeze our gym  membership, so that saves us a little bit of money.  We freeze two or three direct debits, which  saves probably no more than $150.  </p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So, it sounds like the key for you guys in a  nutshell is like you spend the same here as you do there.  So, it doesn't matter where you are.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes.  On a 12 month basis, the average is the same.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             I think for us it's quite funny,  because we do tell people, especially family members that we save money when  we’re away and that’s actually quite common isn’t it?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes, because people think you have  loads of money, but it's not true.  So  they think you've…</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Because you're traveling the world and…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              They think you've won some lottery  or something, and you're not working.   But what it is, it's a risk.  We  just decided to take the risk of not working and run out of money.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So, my next thing I think about then is, I  mean, you guys are fairly young to retire.   Did you have fairly good jobs before and were able? To be able to retire  under 60 is good. At least in the US. Maybe not in the UK.  I mean, do people retire before 60 at home?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             No, we had good jobs for a  protracted period with good bonuses.  We  have excellent pensions.  We both have  excellent pensions, so that's what's enabled us to do it actually.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              But I think they were only good  jobs.  They were good jobs, but they were  good jobs if you believed enough was enough.   If you believe you just want more and more and more, then no, these jobs  wouldn't have been enough.  People would  have wanted more and more and more.  For  us, they were good enough to go to develop this plan. </p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   You said pension, and I don't – I mean, I  don't – in the U.S., I don't know if that's as common any more.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We have a different – you have a  401(k).  We have company pensions, so  servicing companies gives you a pension, so it's different.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   I know some companies - like my mom, I think  gets that because she worked for a government agency or something like  that.  But, is that common the U.K.  for most companies?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Yup. When you're working for a  private company that’s their scheme, and the ones that we worked for were good.  Can we also say the business about the house  as well.  I mean, just to go back a  little bit in the section.  You know, the  important part for us was making a decision that we didn't want a bigger and  bigger house, because obviously that just ties up your whole pension, so that  was real important to us.  We made that  decision probably about 15 years ago that what we had was good enough.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Because your house is paid off.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              It’ a nice house but it’s not  huge.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             But it's not huge, but it was  making that decision that it was enough and we didn't need to keep going higher  and higher, and bigger and better.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   But, I guess what I was saying is that  because of that, you were able to pay it off.   You said you don't have a mortgage.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes.  That's true, but I think people who want  bigger houses obviously children with education, they want bigger cars and so  on are probably the sorts of people who want five-star hotels.  So, this is – what's we're talking about is  not the way they would do it.</p>
                    <p>                        So,  I think modesty is something that is the common thread.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   So, and that – one the questions is how much  do you spend per day on lodging in general here at this hotel?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We try and average $30 the whole  trip.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes, and does that work?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We probably, at the moment, less  than $35, because Mexico  was a little bit more expensive.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             So is Belize as you’ve found out.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              But I think it will work about  right.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   I think our most expensive day was the first  day we got to Cancun, and we spent $48.  We booked it online, had no idea about  anything, and then after that, maybe one day at $40.  In general, I think we spent under $30 almost  every day.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              And we always will have a private  room with a balcony.  So, we – and often,  we breakfasted there so we would not stay in a dormitory.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Right.   This is, I think, only our second dormitory, but in general, yes, we'd  get a private room, $15 to $30.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             We've had - we've done lots of  $20-$25.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes, $20-$25.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              But again, our most expensive was  the same as you.  You might be right,  because we booked it in advance.  So, it  was four or five night in Mexico City,  which was about $50, maybe a bit more.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   I think the thing in that that we found is  that the places that are cheaper, like here, they don't have – you can't book  it online or you can't even find it online.   Maybe you can, but we couldn't find much online.</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Telephone is good. In that sense,  because we booked this by telephone.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Did anybody – before you guys left, and I've  guess you've been traveling for a long time, did anybody try to dissuade you,  like don't go because of danger, or money, or you're crazy or…?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Oh, it's an old chestnut with my  mother any time we go anywhere.   &quot;Oh, it's dangerous there.&quot;, but that's not informed, you  know, that's just maternal feelings.  But  no, I don't think anybody other than her.   I think generally, folks know we've been traveling for a while and  understand why we do it, and generally they're with us.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Yes.   We definitely had a lot of people – we were planning on driving  first.  You know, a lot of people just  telling us, especially in Mexico.  I mean, I had a guy, he actually really  scared me.  He had a friend was  supposedly doing all this research in Mexico and he looked at me and  said, &quot;What are you trying to prove?   Are you trying to prove you're macho to drive through Mexico?&quot;  And, I think it would have been fine.  Our car ended up breaking down before we  left.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              In our earlier traveled, people  did have more concerns.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             When we were younger we were less  experienced travelers then.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              They're more used to us just going  off now.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Now, is there any other things you thought  were interesting or…?  Any other  questions you would have asked or felt would be good?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Well I think age is  important.  I want to say when people  start thinking about their ideas.  You  asked about when we started thinking about this trip.  For some it's a way of life, like with us,  and it's how that way of life evolved.   For example, we finished – we decided to finish work four years ago when  I was laid off, which was conveniently laid off.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Engineered layoff.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   It’s actually about four days a week.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              And we've been – our transition  was to go do two years voluntary service in Nepal, so Peace Corp time voluntary  service.  So for the first two years, we  actually didn't spend anything because we didn't earn anything, and we had a  wonderful experience.  And then came back  from that and then, we have been traveling.   So – and the plan for that started about…</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             1997-98 was when we paid off the  house.  That's when we decided that…</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   I think you had said you had traveled  somewhere.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             We went to India, yes.  We went to India in '97.  That was – and then we took a year out to  travel, and that was really…</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   How did you do that, because – or at least to  me, that's more relevant, because I'm not obviously, at the age I'm ready – how  did you do that year?</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Well, we were giving up  careers.  It didn't cost a huge amount of  money.  Do you remember how much it  cost?  You do, don't you, 10,000 pounds?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Twelve thousand pounds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Twelve thousand pounds for  year.  And you know, it was really  leaving – I mean, David left the Army so it was a big career change, and he was  going to do an MBA, had his place.  So,  it was just – it was the perfect time slot for us to do that.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              That year, by the way, was just –  we averaged $5 a night for accommodations, what was for breakfast, and always  with a bathroom.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             So yes, a bit younger then, and  that just – and it also gave me a big change in terms of career.  It allowed me to settle, because obviously  David had been in the Army, so I'd been following him around.  So, it allowed me to sort of settle into a  good job, so that was great for me.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   You had enough money, though, saved for a  year.  I mean, 12,000 pounds, still I  mean, a lot for year if you're not working.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Well, I had – half of that was  from a grant I had to leave the Army, and the rest I think we borrowed  actually.  Yes, because around that time,  doing an MBA as people do in America,  they borrow a lot of money to do their MBA.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Right.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              So we ended up with quite a  bit to do that.  Maybe we had it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             I think we had it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   You more or less saved the money before you  left.  And then when you came back…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              We'll start to study straight  away.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Okay.   So, a big piece of the key for you here, leaving a job and knowing you  were going to do something new.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes.  So it was a risk, and we left the jobs.  Obviously, I then went into a year of then  not earning more money at business school.   Fiona got a job.  And then the  risk was that I would get a decent job at the end of business school.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Right, which doesn't sound like too much of a  risk, you would think after…</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             It was recession.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Yes, it was 1981…</p>
                    <p>(Crosstalk)</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              It was a very tricky time, but got  a job, a good job, and went from there.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             The other thing, just if I can get  my thoughts straightened out, this is what I was saying yesterday about this  perception of what it's all about.  You  know, you've made the point that people have to want to do it.  It's a mindset thing that's up here, and  maybe some previous experience, but this idea about the cost of it all, I think  that's maybe quite an important point that people think it costs loads of  money, because they're applying their own country's standards, their cost of  living standards to other places.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Or even just the hotels.  I mean, most people are not used to a place  like this.  I mean, there's private  rooms, private bathrooms, it's nice, but there's also like hostel rooms that  bring, so the whole thing just brings down the price.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Exactly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>    Although, the same point that your standards  are definitely not the same.  I mean,  just things people getting used to, like putting toilet paper in the garbage is  sort of like totally crazy to a lot of people.   It was kind of weird to us the first week or two.  So yes, and definitely even other hotels we've  been in and stuff, $30 a night is less – it's not even the same standard to  some degree as like Motel 6.  Some things  are way better, like the garden and the hammocks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             But then there's the other thing,  which is this lovely expression, being not doing, because people go on holiday  and often, they'll go to beaches and they'll lie on the beach, or they'll go  and do things.  They're visiting, doing  things within their two-week holiday or whatever.</p>
                    <p>                        But,  I think the other thing that needs this sort of mindset change is you can't do  it all the time when you're traveling for a protracted period.  So, the fact that you are just sitting – we  had a lazy day yesterday.  We read lots,  we did bits on the computer, we did Sudokus.   So days like that are great days, because you just be.  You're relaxing, and they're okay.  And, I think that was also a little bit early  on, it was quite difficult to sort of say, actually it's okay not to do  anything in a day, unless maybe it was something that people would appreciate understanding.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>              Something just struck me, there  might be a discussion a part you are into about what are the key  ingredients.  Because suddenly I  remember, when we did our first year while traveling, nobody we knew, friends,  said they could do the same thing.  They  all said we couldn’t do that, because we couldn’t spend every minute of a year  with each other.  I think it's a key  thing.  I mean, if you are totally  comfortable with the person you travel with…a year, I mean we used to  joke.  The only time we were apart was  when we went to the toilet, the only time in the whole year we were apart.  And the only big decisions of the day were  where were you going to sleep and where are you going to eat, because for the  rest of the time, it's companion – a lot of the time, it's companionable  silence.  You've got a 12-hour bus ride.  It can be quite – you don't talk all the time  do you, so you have to be very comfortable.</p>
                    <p>                        And,  I just remember people saying, “we couldn't do that, because we couldn’t spend  all that time with each other.”</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Interesting.   That definitely something my mom and one of their friend's who is a  psychologist said that's definitely a thing to look at and watch, and it's hard  to spend all that time, because there's nobody else and you have to depend on  each other.  You know, but if you get in  a fight, then there's nowhere else for you to go.  I mean, you can but you're in a strange city,  and nobody else is around, so they were both you know more or less impressed on  our ability to do it, even though it hasn’t always been the best, but.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fiona:</strong>             Well you know, inevitably, you can  have – there are going to be little bits of tension aren't there, but  generally, that's – it's a really key point.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>   Good.   Cool, thank you very much.</p>
