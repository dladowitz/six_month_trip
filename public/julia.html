                    <p>Julia had the longest trip planned of all the people we've interviewed so far at more than a year. We shared a ride in the back of a pickup truck that offered us all a ride onto the next city. She also had the worst luck of any one we'd run into by having her bag stolen from off a public bus. When we met up with her all she had was a small backpack left. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             It's to try to like make it no so  scary for people to take six months off, because I think what people are afraid  of is just finances.  That's what I  think.  I mean, that's like for me, and  most people I know it's like how can you quit your job, how you can – you have  like mortgage payments or kids or school or whatever.</p>
                    <p>All  right, let me start with the questions that I remember. So,  your name is Julia.  What's your last  name?</p>
<p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Jackson.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Jackson.   And you're 22?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Twenty-three.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And you're from…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               New Zealand.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Welling…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Wellington.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Wellington, okay.  So you've been traveling for nine months  already.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yup.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And how much longer do you have?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               I don't have a time limit.  I just have obviously a money limit.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And basically, why did you want to  do it in the first place.  I think you  said that a lot of people in New    Zealand just do that in general.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes.  So we come from, I think, a pretty different  culture as well, like just firstly, the fact that we're from New Zealand, which  is at the bottom of the world, like an island.   To get anywhere, you have to travel overseas, and to get to any other  major continent, you have to go quite far.   So, I think because of that, people generally tend to go away for  longer, because if you're going to go away and spend 24 hours on a plane or  something, you want to spend a bit of time.</p>
                    <p>                        Also,  because we're so far away…you know, if you lived in England,  you can – they go for weekend trips to Europe  and see all these different things.   Whereas we can't do that, so I think we like to generally take more time  off and it's like, it's quite normal for people do it after they've finished  the university to take a couple of years, go around and see things, explore the  world.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Two or more years at a time?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yeah definitely.  I mean, because what – it's as well Visa things,  like we can go to England for two years and we can only work for one of them,  but you can spend the other year staying in England and traveling around and  stuff or in Britain and traveling around.</p>
                    <p>                        But  I think for me as well, it was just wanting to see how other people lived and  what it was like.  Like, somebody will  say to me, &quot;Oh, you're from New Zealand.  It's such a beautiful country.  Why would you want to leave?&quot;  It like, it doesn't – just because you're  going out and seeing other things doesn't mean anything about what you're life  at home is like.  It just means that you  know, you’re seeing.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             What percentage of the people do  you think travel for more than a year in New Zealand, like after college, and  is it mostly just after college or is it people that are 30, 40, 50 do it also?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Older people definitely travel,  but maybe not so many that take years and years off.  But, I don't really know.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, it's mostly kind of right after  college?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               That's when the big time is  taking a couple of years off is.  I think,  because as well like, so many people go away after university, people like to  continue traveling their whole life, so there are people – you know, lots of  people do different things like taking – going sailing around the world or  taking a couple of years off to do – like even a couple of months at a time.</p>
                    <p>                        Like,  my parents generally try and take a month off every year to go traveling.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Really, a month?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes.  Well the thing like with – because dad works  all the time, and he'll take a month off, but he'll still be working.  But with the Internet and stuff, he can do most  of the work that he needs to.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, how do most people – so, how do  you afford to take a year –maybe a year is how long you're going to be gone you  think?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Probably a bit longer.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay.  How do you afford to do that like without – did  you save up money?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               I saved up for like my whole  life.  Basically, I have been putting  money in saving.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             For this trip or just in general?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Just for saving.  And then I decided – I graduated from uni and  I was working for a couple of months, and just realized that I didn't want to  get stuck into working and stuff before I – because it was the perfect time to  go away and do this, like before I had to have a job that I really care about  and you know, doing any of that stuff.   So, then once you – like especially coming from the university, you're  used to living quite cheaply, not eating out all the time and doing all that  sort of stuff.  So, then I just saved intentively  for like seven months.  Also, I don't  have that much money at all.  Like, I  came away – once I paid for like travel insurance and all the little things you  have to pay in the end, like $8,000 New Zealand dollars.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Which that amount – do you know  what that is in…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Which when I left was like maybe $6,500  American, now it's like $5,000 American.</p>
                    <p>                        And  I've worked.  Like, I spent two months –  two months of that was working and that was actually getting everything paid  for, but not actually making money.  And  I'm going to continue to work.  Like  there's the thing as well.</p>
                    <p>                        A  lot of people who come from like Australia  and New Zealand  who travel can't afford to travel the whole time, but there are so many working  opportunities now, like volunteering and getting jobs.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             How do you find those?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               The easiest, you can look on the  Internet.  There's heaps of Internet  Websites, but they are not always up to date.   The easiest thing is to get to a country, and often the ones that are on  the Internet, they charge you as well, which I don't really – like in some circumstances,  you're just paying for something, but if you're giving quite a lot of your time  and money – there's also like Woofing.   Have you ever heard of that…which is a program called Wellington Workers  on Organic Farms.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             I think maybe I heard you say it  the other day.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               And so, that is like you have to  pay a membership and that gives you like a membership to the World Wide  Databases.  Everyone here has an organic  farm so you just look on the Internet and you find whatever country you want to  go to, and it brings up all the farms that have paid to be a member as  well.  And then you can see if you like  what they're doing and what they offer you, and in generally, it'll be like  they'll offer you all your food and board, and then you work maybe six hours a  day.  And the idea is that they sort of  teach you about organic farming methods as well.  So, it's like you're learning.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And that's what you're doing in Lake  Atitlan?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               They have a woofing farm there,  but I'm working in the hotel.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay.  And so you're – and you said  - where was the other you worked at?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               In Ecuador.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And so you're doing it twice on  your trip or more maybe?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Maybe more.  I wanted to get an actual paying job to make  some money, but we'll see what happens.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes.  So, the key for you it sounds like is having  some savings and then planning for like seven months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yeah, and then being – you've  just got to know how to travel as well.   Like, you could travel for seven months and spend $20,000 American  easily like if you want to.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, and that's what most Americans  think of with travel.  Like, most  Americans think of $100 to $200 a night of…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Whoa.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Just Americans – I mean like most  Americans – maybe not just straight out of college.  Like, when I did not an internship but an  exchange program in London  the first semester and then traveled for a month or two after that, and  definitely did it very similar to this.   But, I think most people if they're not in college or just out think of  travel – of course, you only have usually a week or two, so you can spend  $1,000 in a week or two.  So, that's kind  of – I don't think Americans really think about traveling for six months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes, because you couldn't.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, if you spent $100 a day on  just like a hotel room or something.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Also, think if you did that sort  of travel for six months, you'd probably get really bored, because it's quite  safe to travel.  Like whereas, the people  who travel for longer times, tend to go to like more developing countries and  stuff like that because it's quite a different culture.  It's a lot more interesting.  There's often more things to do like more  outdoors.  And then you could probably  even do it cheaper than I did, like if you did <strong>catch</strong> surfing as well.  Have  you heard of that?<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>David</strong>:             Yes.  I've definitely seen that.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               I mean, that's in almost every  country now.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Do you have like a daily budget  that you planned out before hand?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               It varies from country to  country.  Like, I did for a while try and  – not actually budgeting but more just writing down everything that I spend and  then figuring it out.  But I always like  am conscious of what I'm spending and I know – like, I generally try and spend  less than $20 a day American.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Even with lodging, that's pretty  good.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               It's doable.  I mean, like here, this is one of the more  expensive places that I'd stay in.  Like  $8 a night, but I think that's sort of like what El Salvador seems to be about.  But that's $8, and then you've still got $12  for everything like.  Like, if you're not  moving around a lot.  That's another  thing is when you travel quickly, you spend way more money, because you've got  to pay for buses the whole time.  And  so….and then you've got $12 for food, which is heaps.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, what's the route you've taken  so far?  I know it might be a long…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               So, I started in Argentina in  Buenos Aires, and I didn't go into Patagonia, like Southern Argentina.  But then I went up to Paraguay for a couple  of days and through there, back to Argentina, over to Chile, but I just went  basically straight up through Chile, didn't see very much, into Bolivia.  Spent about seven weeks in Bolivia, and then went to Peru, and then from Peru  to Ecuador and Ecuador to Colombia.  From Colombia, I took a cargo boat,  which costs like $30 for nine days of travel and living.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Oh really?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes, through – because otherwise,  the only other options are like really expensive flights or like a $350 sailboat.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But up to Panama?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, you were on it for nine days?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Because, well it took – it should  only take four, but they got drunk a lot basically.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So it takes – but isn't it – aren't  they…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               It takes four days.  It's a very slow boat.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But aren't they only a canal away  from each other?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               No, the canal doesn't go through  – the canal goes from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right – wait, you're talking about  – Colombia and Panama  touch each other.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Part of them do.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               But it's call the <strong>Daring Gate</strong>.  You can't travel through there.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Oh, okay.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Well, you can if you have like –  if you're crazy and you have a very expensive, local guide, because it's just  like crazy dense jungle with mosquitoes.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, it's not even the canal that's  really the problem.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               No, the canal is not a  canal.  The Panama  canal isn't between Colombia  or Panama.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay, it's in Panama.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes, it's in Panama.  It goes from like the two sides of Panama,  east to west.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Right.  Is there a bridge over it?  Like do people cross right over it?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               No.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So people – I mean, the northern  part of Panama, you can't  like get to the southern part of Panama unless they take a boat?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               No, they can.  It's not like straight.  It's weird when you look at the canal.  Like, I don't know – yes, it's not – it  doesn't cut the country in half and you don't have to cross the canal.  I don't know how it works.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             And when you go home, do you have –  where are you going to stay when you get home, because you don't – do you have  an apartment or do you…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               No.  See, here's what I did.  Like, I packed up everything and got rid of  all my stuff basically, because I didn't have – that's the other thing about  now as well.  I didn't have furniture and  stuff that I really cared about.  Like, I  had my bed and table and chairs and stuff, but they weren't nice, so I just  sold or gave away all that sort of stuff, left maybe about two boxes of stuff  with my parents.  And yes, I was just  renting a place, not hard to give up.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, that's what we did.  We just, more than two boxes, but…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               I mean, which is why I can  understand.  Like, if you've got a  mortgage and stuff, then it is – it's not only the fact.  But then, like I know a lot of people who  have traveled.  Like, one of the girls I  worked with in Quito was a 35 year old and she had a mortgage and stuff, but  she was getting – she had lodgers in there so they were – and I think what she  actually wanted to do when she went home was keep them staying there, because  it was actually working out better for her to have them renting a house and she  stayed with friends or whatever, or find an even cheaper apartment.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, it probably doesn't apply to  you as much just because of the culture of New Zealand.  But, did people try to dissuade you from  going for such a long time because of either danger or money or anything?  I'm guessing no, but…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               People…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Or what about just traveling like  as a single woman.  I mean, did people  worry about that?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes.  They definitely worried, but then you can  always – there is always sort of like a friend of a friend who has done a  similar thing, you know, like in New Zealand so that you know that it's not too  them.  And definitely, like my parents  were worried about that, but then mom traveled through Africa  when she was my age by herself.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             She didn't have a lot of say.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               She can't really – yes, exactly.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Have you seen – have you felt any  problems or been scared just because you're traveling alone or not really?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               No.  I felt much safer than I expected to actually  most of the time.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes.  I know that’s what we find.  Well, it was a little scary going into a  country because people always warn us about you know Guatemala,  they warn you about El Salvador,  and you know, Belize.  They worry about Guatemala.  But you know, once we get here, it's been  fine.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes.  Any of the violent crime they don't want to  hurt tourists.  Like, there is definitely  probably violent crime in El Salvador, but it's within – for El Salvadorians</p>
                    <p>                        Like,  I was working in Quito and that's a very, very dangerous city.  Like, I'd say 70% to 80% of the people who stayed  in hostel got robbed in some way, or like, attempted.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             In the hostel or just in general?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               No, like out in the city.  But none of it's violent.  Like, at the most, they'll have a knife, but  they don't want to confront you.  They're  just – you know, it's pick pocketing, because all they're after with tourists  is money.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, and that's what I  decided.  As long as like – I said the  only two things I didn't want to happen is to go into debt and have any violent  crime happen to us.  Other than that, I  was like, I don't care if all our stuff gets stolen.  If whatever, if we run out of money half way  through and have to go home as long as we just don't go into debt or have  violent crime happen.  Which, I haven't  really – I mean, I've heard a couple of stories about violence, but it's never  from somebody who had experienced it or really – or even somebody who knows a  person.  It was always like a story of a  story of somebody else.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Which then you're never really  sure that it happened.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             How do you think most people in New Zealand  can afford to pay?  Do you think it's a  similar thing, like they save up through college or their parents help them, or  they just they work?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               I lot of people would go to Australia  for a wee while and work, because they'd get paid better and then go traveling.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So, kind of…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Or work at the same time.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             While they're traveling.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               …as traveling, yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             So you think that's a big piece of  – for you and for people of sort of just taking a small part – maybe the same  amount of time, like seven months of planning and saving, and then traveling  for seven months, or 14 months or whatever it is.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes, for a year or year and a  half, yes.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Interesting.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Because I mean, if you like – you  get used to having whatever income you have.   But I think like – so once you just say to yourself, well, I'm going to  cut half of that and save, half of it, and then it's not actually hard.  You know, you just adjust to whatever you've  got.  And if you just automatically,  like, I had automatic payments going out as soon as my money went in, so you  know, you never saw it.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes, I know.  That's what I did, just had an automatic,  from my job just send it to a savings account automatically.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Spend a wee while not going out  for dinner twice a week or having – buying alcohol every night or whatever.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Yes.  It's definitely something that's not, at  least in the American…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               Yes.  I even talked to a lot of locals like  here.  I remember in Colombia I did it a lot and like, in Ecuador  and stuff, and explaining to them about it.   Because they were always really fascinated as well.  Like, just answer the questions, like how  much money do you have and how much money do you spend and how do you do it and  stuff.  And they would never think of it  as well, because it's just not – you know, like I can definitely understand  that culturally, you feel like you have to sort of work and make money for  yourself and support other people, but it's so easy to do.  Once you start thinking about it and…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             No, I agree.  We only saved for five months maybe,  something like four or five months.  It  wasn't even that long of time.  Now I  mean, I'm having this thought now.  I  want to plan like every two years just take six months off and with two years  of time to save, it could be really easy.   I mean, I don't know.  Americans  just don't do it.</p>
                    <p>                        I  think maybe more for Americans it's taking the time off, which is hard.  I mean, I only did it because I was planning  on leaving my job anyway, so I didn't really care.  But I think – you know, I had some people  that have said, &quot;Oh, I couldn't take six months off in the middle of my  career&quot;, which is hard, because if you've worked for there for like three  or four years and you've built up – you know, how you're a manager or  something, you don't want to throw that away.   But, I think there's some other piece to that though.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               But, from a lot of people that  I've talked to, they have got – their businesses were fine with them leaving  and coming back in six months, and they'll still have the same job.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             But if most – people don’t do it in  New Zealand that much later on, like 30 or 40, it's not that common?  Not that you might be like best friends with  many 40 year olds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               That's why I'm trying to  think.  Probably not really common, but  it's still not totally unheard of to move to other places, pack up your things  and…</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Take off.  You know, I didn't even think it.  I mean, I've met so many people, foreigners  that are living here, not necessarily in El   Salvador, but in Belize  and Guatemala and Mexico  that the money goes farther, and I just didn't realize so many people did that.</p>
                    <p>                        Okay.  I think those are all the questions.  I don't know, is there anything else you want  to add you thought was interesting or would…</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               I don't know.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay.  Cool.   So, yes.  If this ever becomes  anything, I'll send it to you.  And this  is – where are we right now?  We're in –  what city is this?</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               El Tunco.</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             El Tunco in El  Salvador.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia</strong>:               That took me a while, didn’t it?</p>
                    <p><strong>David</strong>:             Okay cool.  That is it.</p>
